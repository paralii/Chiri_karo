/**
 * Strips Mongo operator keys ($gt, $where, ...) and dotted keys from
 * req.body and req.params to block NoSQL-injection payloads.
 *
 * req.query is intentionally left untouched: in Express 5, req.query is
 * a getter derived from the raw URL on each access, not a plain mutable
 * property, so reassigning or deep-mutating it here is unreliable
 * (this is the same reason `express-mongo-sanitize` is unsafe on Express 5).
 * None of this app's routes build Mongo filters from req.query, so the
 * exposure is limited to body/params, which this covers.
